<p><strong>ADVISORY</strong>: Article contains strong language</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it</p>

  <p>— George Santayana</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indian Govt led by fascist BJP is planning to conduct a country wide hunt for “<a href="https://theprint.in/opinion/with-assam-nrc-the-truth-is-also-out-it-was-a-pointless-exercise-all-along/284929/">alleged</a>” illegal immigrants with the unspecified intent of punishing the poor, illiterate &amp; most importantly <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/politics/bjp-vows-to-strip-muslim-immigrants-of-vote-in-assam-1214700.html">Muslims</a>.
The primary goal is show people that they being in Govt can do whatever the hell they want to do to push the country towards <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hegde-kicks-up-a-fresh-row-with-remarks-on-secularism/article22271584.ece?homepage=true">anti-secular</a> <a href="https://hinduexistence.org/2017/05/18/remove-secular-from-constitution-to-make-bharat-as-hindu-state-togadia/">Goonish Hindu state</a> &amp; we all can do nothing about it.
The whole exercise of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/nrc-across-country-will-send-excluded-out-amit-shah-6008047/">National Register of Citizens (NRC)</a> is a ploy to intimidate, discriminate, punish, steal the property of Muslims &amp; the ultimate humiliation of making them stateless.</p>

<p>In this article, I’ll explain everything I said above with sufficient documentory evidence.
I will also give you reasons as to why we must fight this fascistic move tooth &amp; nail.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong>
I will boycott this fascist NRC &amp; will not submit my documents for verification. I have no reason to prove to these fascist Goons that I am an Indian. You too should do the same &amp; join street protests to oppose this. If enough of us boycott it, there is nothing they can do about it.</p>

<p>Here are the list of reasons (each point explained later in detail)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Its plain unjust</li>
  <li>Its based on a proven lie</li>
  <li>Its a fascist wedge to humiliate Muslims, take over their property &amp; make them stateless</li>
  <li>Needless misery of the most vulnerable</li>
  <li>NRC = Demonetisation 2.0</li>
  <li>Ploy to distract from every other important issue</li>
  <li>Cost of implementation</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Congress, AAP &amp; most of Indian opposition parties have self castrated themselves long back &amp; have no fighting spirit in them.
They are in no mood to fight for their own turf, let alone fighting for you (or) for me (or) for our Muslim brothers and sisters (or) any just cause for that matter.
These opportunistic cowards even <a href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/aap-hails-scrapping-of-article-370-supports-bill-on-bifurcation-of-j-k/cid/1695887">praised</a> the illegal annexation of Kashmir in an unconstitutional manner by Goons sitting in Delhi.
They supported it despite knowing it to be immoral &amp; unconstitutional while also knowing the whole annexation happened under the pretence of a <a href="https://thewire.in/politics/bjp-kashmir-terrorist-threat-lie-article-370">lie</a>, thru <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-49481180">military terror</a>, in the hopes that thru brute state terror legitimate aspirations of millions of Kashmiris can be suppressed.</p>

<p>Indian Courts are fully compromised &amp; these unaccountable black gowns of Supreme Court are the ones who imposed this cruel NRC on Assam &amp; sat idle for more than 100 days while the <a href="https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/kashmir-internet-shutdown-for-over-100-days-a-violation-of-right-to-life-submits-dushyant-dave-149949">fundamental rights of Kashmiries are violated</a> thru military terror.</p>

<p>There is nothing we can expect from the cowardly, corrupt &amp; opportunistic opposition (or) the so-called “courts” of this country.
Injustice is <em>not</em> the exception in our country, its the rule &amp; its unleashed thru various state organs in cohorts with Indian courts.</p>

<p>Both opposition &amp; courts are nothing more than power brokers who are interested in their own power &amp; none of the responsibilities that come with it.
They are passive collaborators in the sinister majoritarian Hindutva anti-secular game played by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/reports-of-hate-crime-cases-have-spiked-in-india/">thugs of BJP</a>.
Anytime a serious issue of principle is involved, this joke of an opposition immediately runs into hiding/side with injustice.
This is what enabled the thugs of BJP to abuse the system this openly &amp; brazenly.
These opposition parties seek vote in the name of Secularism by scaring everyone that the Goon (BJP) is really awful. But instead of protesting on street &amp; forcing these fascists to backdown, all they do is Drama sitting in this air-conditioned houses—while thier agents in media do thier bidding (promoting them).
We have seen this Good Cop, Bad Cop nonsense for long enough from opposition.</p>

<p>[Despite his own flaws] Gandhi organised protests to fight foreign invaders thru non-violence &amp; non-cooperation.
Its not that hard to fight these domestic fascist bullies who are children of Godse (Gandhi’s killer). 
If enough of us hit streets in protests &amp; tell them that we will boycott this domestic fascist move of NRC, there is nothing they can do about it.
The more you let a bully win, the more pain he inflicts on everyone around him.
Our compliance &amp; silence emboldens the bully.
Lets disabuse ourselves for once by telling the bully that he can only bully us when we are divided, not when we are united.</p>

<p>Prime Goon<sup id="fnref:prime-goon"><a href="#fn:prime-goon" class="footnote">1</a></sup> aka <a href="https://www.modilies.in/">Conman</a> aka Modi is a <a href="https://thewire.in/media/narendra-modi-press-conference">Coward</a>.
He cant even take an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbOQa8p080A">unscripted question</a> &amp; needs to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3PKuc9Nsb4">drink water</a> when anyone asks an unscripted question.
I have no doubt he will cry like a baby if any journalist who is worth his salt confronts him on his criminal track record in Gujrat. 
Just like his Guru Savarkar who wrote <a href="https://thewire.in/history/bhagat-singh-and-savarkar-a-tale-of-two-petitions">apology letters to British begging them to release him from prison during freedom struggle</a>, these bullies are the most cowardly bunch you will ever encounter.
The more we sit silent, the more they do whatever the hell they want to do.</p>

<p>We need to hit the streets &amp; oppose these fascist snakes that spew venomous communal poison on day to day basis, which are born in that snake pit RSS.</p>

<p>Here are the reasons why we all should oppose NRC, both online &amp; offline. Most importantly offline, by hitting the streets in protests.</p>

<h2 id="1-its-plain-unjust">1. Its plain unjust</h2>

<p>Jurisprudence is found on the basic principle that everyone is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence">innocent until proven guilty</a>.
In case of NRC, everyone is guilty until proven innocent.
This is the reversal of the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)">burden of proof</a>.
Instead of Govt proving someone is guilty, we all have to prove we are innocent of the crimes we did not commit.
This is the law of despots who dont care for the suffering they inflict on others.
Its the opposite of justice.</p>

<p>Why should a whole country needs to prove they are not criminals?
This is an unreasonable &amp; cruel standard &amp; <a href="https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/everything-you-want-to-know-about-the-nrc/cid/1352646">Supreme Court of India was the enabler</a> of this cruelty.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a rape happens in a city, you dont ask all male members to come and prove they are not the rapists, rather Govt has the burden to go, find and ultimately prove who the actual guilty party is—with evidence—in the court of law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only in fascist kafkaesque unjust societies do everyone needs to prove that they not guilty of the crimes they did not commit</p>

<h2 id="2-its-based-on-a-proven-lie">2. Its based on a proven lie</h2>

<p>BJP &amp; the poisonous tree from which its born, RSS have insisted Assam is overflowing with illegal <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/07/11/indias-hunt-for-illegal-immigrants-is-aimed-at-muslims">Bangladeshi Muslim immigrants</a>.
Now, that Assam NRC is over, it has come about that the <a href="https://thewire.in/government/hindus-muslims-forged-documents-nrc">number of Hindus who forged documents is much higher than Muslims</a>.
The whole lie of BJP fell on its face.</p>

<p>When their lie is fully exposed, sore losers of BJP wants to impose one more round of NRC on Assamese &amp; also want all of us to prove that we are not illegals.
Why should we?
These fascists lied that there were <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/india-news-even-hindus-are-illegal-immigrants-in-assams-ambitious-national-register-of-citizens-bjp-on-backfoot/302099">crores of illegal immigrants</a>.
Now its a proven lie.</p>

<p>Most of these people who are not yet in the register are yet to exhaust all their legal options.
Many of these people are not yet in the system because our system is so flawed.
Many of these people are still Indians because very few people prior to 1980s have documentary evidence as we are not documentation based society historically, especially in villages.</p>

<h2 id="3-its-a-fascist-wedge-to-humiliate-muslims-take-over-their-property--make-them-stateless">3. Its a fascist wedge to humiliate Muslims, take over their property &amp; make them stateless</h2>

<p>Soon after becoming Chancellor, Hitler passed <a href="https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/anti-jewish-legislation-in-prewar-germany">citizen laws</a> that every German needs to prove they are “real” Germans thru blood &amp; ancestry.
All those who could not prove they are Germans with documentary evidence and/or blood lines were declared illegals.
They were subjected to violence, humiliation, sent to concentration camps, made stateless, their properties taken over by fascist Germans &amp; millions of jews finally paid the ultimate price with life.</p>

<p>The poisonous snakes of RSS who spout the <a href="https://sabrangindia.in/article/hate-watch-bjp-mla-raja-singh-officially-repeat-offender-hate-speech">most venomous communal poison</a> on day to day basis are founded by those who consider <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/national/golwalkar-drew-lessons-from-hitlers-germany/article7924161.ece">Hitler to be a great man</a> &amp; <a href="https://thewire.in/world/german-ambassador-walter-lindner-rss-headquarters">Nazism to be a great philosophy</a>.
These goons now want to do the same with Muslims &amp; other minorities.
Its immoral to sit idle while these fascists impose this level of cruelty on our fellow citizens.</p>

<h2 id="4-needless-misery-of-the-most-vulnerable">4. Needless misery of the most vulnerable</h2>

<p>No good reason is provided to prove that India is overwhelmed with illegal immigrants &amp; all evidence point in the opposite direction, i.e spite to punish Muslims.
I am from a village background &amp; my village is not in a remote place in India.
Even then when I went to pursue my master of engineering degree (out of state, which I dropped out of), I never had any documentation—other than my education certificates—as evidence of my existence (not even voter id as I dint apply for one back then).</p>

<p>If a person like me who atleast has some level of education had nothing much to show for other than my education certificates (&amp; my parent’s documentation assuming thier name is spelled correctly &amp; there is no translation mismatch between thier names in my mother tongue &amp; English in older documents) to prove my existence, because of this fascist NRC, we somehow have to pretend all poor &amp; illiterate have documentary evidence dating as far back as 1980s, i.e ~40years back to prove they were here in India before that?
For what? To satisfy a small group of Hindu fascists who lied &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Gujarat_riots">murdered thier way</a> to the top political position in the country &amp; want to use NRC as a wedge to further their bigotry &amp; state sponsored cruelty?</p>

<p>Most rich people will have documentation for quite a long time because they had land &amp; so held decent amount of documentation, but what about all those vulnerable people who live in slums without much documentation?
A large % of people in cities will have documentation when compared to villagers because villages operate on the principle of trust, does not require &amp; does not use as much documentation. You will find a farmer rarely selling his produce with paper trail.</p>

<p>This whole NRC exercise is a ploy to punish poor, minorities, illiterate, slum dwellers, villagers, landless peasants, Dalits, vagabonds, beggars, people who ran away from house, abandoned kids &amp; more.
This exercise will inflict needless misery on everyone, especially the poorest &amp; the most vulnerable (minorities) amongst us.</p>

<h2 id="5-nrc--demonetisation-20">5. NRC = Demonetisation 2.0</h2>

<p>The naked emperor’s Tughlaq decision of <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2016/12/03/the-dire-consequences-of-indias-demonetisation-initiative">Demonetisation</a> has <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2017/01/07/the-high-economic-costs-of-indias-demonetisation">destroyed the whole economy</a>.
Neo Tughlaq even went so far as to <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-politically-inconvenient-data-nugget/article29214638.ece">suppress this data</a>.
We are currently on our way to <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/if-india-stopped-growing-would-imf-and-world-bank-say-so">economic depression</a>.
This Neo Tughlaq has no right to impose one more Tughlaqi decision &amp; unleash this level of cruelty on us all once again—let alone on larger scale &amp; one that has severe consequences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Demonetization 1.0 destroyed economic fabric of this country, Demonetization 2.0 (NRC) will destroy the social fabric of this country &amp; instill state terror into everyone’s heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These Goons are doing everything they can to destroy the social fabric by inciting communal violence in UP, Rajastan &amp; everywhere they rule.</p>

<p>NRC is a ploy to tell all of us that the Servant (Govt) is stronger than the Master (Citizen) &amp; the master should be terrified of the servant.
We should never let that happen.
Hundreds died <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/12/08/indias-demonetisation-kills-100-people-apparently-this-is-not-an-important-number/">needless death</a> standing in queues when the terror of Demonetization 1.0 was unleashed.
Many committed <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/man-declared-foreigner-dies-in-assam-family-refuses-to-accept-body-2116629">suicide in Assam</a> because of NRC.</p>

<p>Why should we as citizens pay the ultimate price for the fascistic fantasises of Modern Tughlaq who is holding PM seat?</p>

<h2 id="6-ploy-to-distract-from-every-other-important-issue">6. Ploy to distract from every other important issue</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_and_awe">Shock &amp; Awe</a> is the tactic of fascists.
They unleash unimaginable pain on people (Shock) &amp; while we are surprised (Awe) &amp; struggle to recover from that shock, they unleash another cruel shock.
Illegal Kashmir annexation &amp; the subsequent <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/deathly-silence-an-inside-look-at-kashmir-a-1296450-amp.html">unaccountable military terror</a> (Shock) &amp; while people are shocked (Awe) and struggle to get justice on that front, these goons are planning to push one more cruel thing onto rest of the country.</p>

<p>When we are completely distracted with needless but life changing cruel acts, we will stop worrying about real important things &amp; start worrying about these madeup crises.</p>

<p>Lakhs of crores of our money in Banks is looted &amp; Prime Goon forgave all these crooks by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-1140000000000-bad-debts-the-great-govt-bank-write-off/">writing off</a> all the amount without any serious implications to those who screwed us.
The <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/india-unemployment-rate-6-1-per-cent-45-year-high-nsso-report-1539580-2019-05-31">unemployment is unprecedented</a>.
The <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maharashtra-farmer-suicide-1553467-2019-06-21">farmer’s lives</a> are miserable.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bpcl-employees-to-protest-privatisation/article29685122.ece">profit making Govt. companies like BPCL</a> will be sold to his friends Ambani/Adani.
Why should profit making public companies be sold?
Do Ambani needs to build one <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/content/108813/soaring-above-poverty-ambanis-27.html">more vulgar billion dollar house</a> that he earned by rigging rules in his favor &amp; loot public—instead of public basic needs be taken care of?
When our schools are so bad, when our roads are awful, when people go bankrupt if they have any serious illness because of hospital costs, when Govt have no money to build new hospitals, whats the need to give our money to Ambani/Adani &amp; make these grifters even more richer by selling them BPCL?</p>

<p>When we are distracted with this needless misery of NRC, the fascists who currently rule us can complete the transformation this country into a fascist shit hole.
When we are distracted with deliberate cruelty like this, we stop paying attention to the fact that we are being fucked from behind by these fascists &amp; thier grifting friends.</p>

<p>That’s the real game plan.</p>

<h2 id="7-cost-of-implementation">7. Cost of implementation</h2>

<p>Assam is a smaller state &amp; there in order to conduct this moronic exercise of NRC, more than <a href="https://nagalandtoday.in/editorial/2019/11/people-left-out-of-nrc-in-assam-spent-rs-7836-crore-for-hearings-rights-body-survey/">~₹8,000 crores (~₹1,100 crores Govt + rest by people) was spent</a>, 65,000 workers were deployed &amp; the whole state of Assam were forced to travel, collect documentation &amp; forced to go thru miserable avoidable suffering.
What about the lost productivity of all those who have to travel, wait in lines to prove they are not illegals?
Many of the people who were deployed to verify these documents are teachers, yes, <a href="https://twitter.com/RuhulAlam72/status/1197808864583802880">teachers were asked to verify documents</a> instead of teaching kids.</p>

<p>Now the Goons sitting in Delhi wants to conduct <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/assam-bjp-unhappy-with-final-nrc-list-demands-nationwide-citizens-list/articleshow/70925109.cms">one more round of NRC in Assam</a> along with rest of India.
What about all that ₹8,000 crores that Govt + people just spent in Assam?
Who cares?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When they lose a game, the goal of fascists is forcing a rematch until they win, no matter the consequences to rest of the society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assam is a small state with a population of <a href="https://indiapopulation2019.com/population-of-assam-2019.html">~35 million people</a> &amp; they spent roughly ₹8,000 crores in aggregate.
How many crores will we need to spend on this cruel, unnecessary &amp; immoral exercise across a country with a population of <a href="https://indiapopulation2019.com/">~1353 million</a>?</p>

<p>(1353÷35) × ₹8,000 crores = ~₹3 lakh crores?</p>

<p>What about lost productivity because everyone now have to perform a useless task of proving they are Indian citizens?</p>

<p>For what?
So that Modern Tughlaq and his fascist regime can use us as pawn to satisfy their fascistic thirst &amp; use the consequences of the resultant fire they started as political currency in destroying Democracy?</p>

<p>Can we even begin to put a number on the misery of everyone who has to suffer thru this?</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Time for laughing at jokes aimed at these cowardly, cruel, criminal, fascistic &amp; poisonous fools of RSS &amp; BJP is over.
If we laugh at them even now, the joke is on us for letting Neo Tughlaq implement this fascist NRC.
Lets <del>follow Gandhi’s footsteps &amp;</del><sup id="fnref:gandhi-flaws"><a href="#fn:gandhi-flaws" class="footnote">2</a></sup> hit the streets to protest these fascist cowards.</p>

      <p>The more I learnt about Gandhi, the more I realised the flaws of this man, such as rewriting of his own history in South Africa during his life time, well calculated deception when it comes to supporting the rotten caste system, taking huge sums of money from his corporate friends who exploited workers &amp; sabotaged worker unions from within, narcicissm to let his sycopants to refer to him as “Mahatma” (Great soul) while he was still alive. So, I dont think we need to follow flawed people. Rather its better to stick with the priciple of justice rather than idealising men, flawed or not.
