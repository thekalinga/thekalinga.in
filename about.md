Hi, I am Ashok Koyi. I live in Bangalore, India.

I am the Founder CTO & Software Architect at [1Ton Technologies](https://1ton.in){:target="\_blank"} [*Website is not yet live*]. I program mainly in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)) with ~16 years of experience (15.8 to be exact) with major chunk of experience in Server side programming. I did design, built apps from ground up in Angular (Javascript, CSS, HTML) & Android along with design & implementation of serverside APIs, database design. However, I need to brush on Angular & Android parts as these skills of mine are a bit rusty now. As to the server side bits, they are as good as new as I constantly use them.

I built applications that were both RPC based & event driven (both with & without messaging backing). I have decent understanding of the overall breadth of product & technology landscape & a reasonable depth in important areas so my knowledge is not mere shallow.

I am a jack of many trades covering product development end to end --- starting from requirement gathering to analysis to design to development to testing (unit & integration) to deployment to monitoring ... & feedback from customers driving next round.

I have managed multiple teams --- Server, UI & QA teams --- for a while I was at Philips as Software Architect prior to founding 1Ton Technologies.

This is my home on the internet where I share my learning experiences, experiments & opinions/rants on technology, society, economy & corruption. You are welcome to criticize my views/opinions with facts.

I have built production grade applications using

- [Spring WebFlux](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html)
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
