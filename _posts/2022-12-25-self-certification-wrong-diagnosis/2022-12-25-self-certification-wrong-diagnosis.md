_ADVISORY_: Article contains strong language.

I came across [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20221223072059/https://www.outlookindia.com/national/why-the-recent-attack-on-judiciary-is-absolutely-uncalled-for-magazine-246901) written by a former Indian Supreme Court Judge. The thrust of his argument is Government (Executive branch) of Indian State is attempting to undermine Judges (Judicial branch) by publicly making adverse comments against Judiciary & author says this is wrong.

This made me think about an irritating & infectious disease aka "culture" I see pervasive throughout Indian society, especially amongst our ruling class --- one of _self-certification_. This irritating disease of giving self-certificates or getting certificates from ones buddies (buddy-certificates) or getting certificates from one's subordinates[^masturbation-circle-jerk-bdsm], has become more or less a second nature to our ruling class (from now on, I will use _self-certification_ to mean all 3 mechanisms I just described). Once someone treads this path of self-certification , one will skip over foundational issues, arrives at a wrong diagnosis & ultimately proposes solutions that drive them to incorrect destination.

[^masturbation-circle-jerk-bdsm]: People also call self-certification as masturbation; buddy certification as circle-jerk & subordinates giving certificates to bosses as BDSM.

Pick any section of ruling class/ruling class-adjacent --- Executive/Government (Police, Army, ...), Legislature, Judiciary, Election Commission, Capitalists, "Journalists", White collar jobs --- Lawyers, Managers, Entertainers, Engineers, ... (or) any group that can exercise authority in any manner; most of them give self-certificates. Incase of Executive & Judiciary, if any critic commits the "crime" of having heterodox opinion about these BS certificates, expresses their contempt openly in a concrete & visible manner --- thanks to World's Best Constitution™[^worlds-best-constitution] we have in India --- they can \[& often will\] be "legally" terrorised with a credible threat to critic's liberty/property/person. In case of other groupings, they will "legally" harass (or) shun them by denying access & make the critic an outcast.

[^worlds-best-constitution]: Indian Constitution mockingly called World's Best Constitution™ is written by so-called "freedom fighters" aka agents of Indian rich --- Nehru & co. A good portion of this Constitution is copied from an ordinary law British wrote for its Indian subjects. With enough loopholes in Constitution to terrorise & lord over everyone through "lawful" violence, threat of violence, lies, secrecy & lawfare, these "freedom fighters" claimed their subjects "gave themselves" this Constitution (Preamble to Indian Constitution: WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA ... GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION). One wonders: With a Constitution like this, who needs tyranny? With "freedom fighters" like this, who needs freedom?

## Legitimacy

Let's take a look at the legitimacy of Judicial Bureaucrats & Executive/Legislature in India.

What legitimacy does a Judicial bureaucratic wing has, which none of us ever agreed is a neutral arbitrator, in adjudicating all our disputes --- affecting ~1.4 billion people?

How about Executive/Legislative wings?

Does forcing people to press a button \[in voting machine\] once every 5yrs amounts to people giving informed consent? Aren't these "elections" in our so-called "Democracy" nothing but sham exercises in which most/all of us are coerced to certify the transfer of power from one faction of ruling class to another faction of ruling class --- even if we dont want to give up power --- with our role curtailed to mere button pressing \[in voting machine\]/checking a box \[in ballot paper\] & STFU?

Does a system in which we barely have any say (in reality almost none) in how its actually run have any legitimacy?

With that background, lets now take a look at the framing of argument from the article.

## Anarchy

The Judge writes

> The citizens of this country have great faith in the judiciary. Such strident attacks may erode that faith. If this happens, our country would cease to be governed by the rule of law and only anarchy and tyranny will reign. ...

I cant tell if these statements are borne out of ignorance (or) delusion (or) class solidarity with his \[ruling\] class (or) its a claptrap.

This man is an insider, recently retired as a Judge from Supreme Court of India. Why is he trying to appropriate the agency of avg person, cloak himself as a member of "citizens" grouping & make claims on behalf of this mythical "citizen" he has invented in his head? Shall we also allow all other members of ruling class of this country (Modi, Adani, Ambani, Arvind Kejriwal, Rahul Gandhi, ...) to make claims in similar manner "having great faith" in the illegitimate power their class usurped, on behalf of this mythical "citizen"? Is he doing this to artificially boost credibility for members of his own class --- buddy Judges in Supreme Court? He is not a poor man, not even an average person on the street, definitely not a powerless person (Clue: Powerless people won't be allowed to write their opinion in Indian mainstream media owned by Capitalists). Despite retiring, he is still a member of the ruling class of India as he can still peddle influence through his connections.

There is a saying that goes something like: _fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me_. Given what we know about the history of Indian Supreme Court & its appointments (self-dealing & collusion with all forces of hegemony --- Executive, Capital, Majoritarianism, Casteism, Misogyny, ...), who are these people that have "great faith" in our so-called "Supreme" & "Justices"[^judge-as-justice]? Why are Indians gaslit by their ruling class & its agents that they must have an irrational & religious faith in these institutions that lords over them with no accountability? Is it because victims of Indian ruling class[^ruling-class-incl-judiciary] don't have a choice in the matter except accepting proclamations from them --- however anti-factual & irrational these proclamations might be?

[^judge-as-justice]: In India --- like in many other countries --- Judges call themselves "Justices". They think so highly of themselves, lack self-awareness to such a degree, that they won't mind butchering the word _Justice_.

[^ruling-class-incl-judiciary]: _Ruling class_ includes Judiciary.

Apparently, "rule of law" i.e. imposition of laws \[that none of us consented to voluntarily\] is somehow good --- even if the laws are bad & actively harmful (which many Indian laws are including the mother of all bad laws --- World's Best Constitution™ --- the foundational law of India). Why?

Anarchy is the absence of Tyranny.

Is the author using a different definition of Anarchy i.e. _chaos_, which is what all other political structures (including current one we are coerced to live under in India) that are built around domination/tyranny create? Anarchism does have order, but it's not the kind of order that's enforced through domination/tyranny (which is what State is all about), rather it's the order achieved through non-dominating means i.e. voluntary cooperation backed by autonomy & self-defence.

>Definition
>
>Anarchism: The political theory that a community is best organized by the voluntary cooperation of individuals, rather than by a government, which is regarded as being coercive by nature.

In essence, Anarchy --- the philosophy behind Anarchism --- is the ultimate goal of a mature society, where everyone will be able to fulfill one's potential, to live life how one wishes to live through voluntary cooperation without being dominated by another individual/group. This requires ensuring no one accumulates disproportionate power (political/economical/social/weaponry/...) to threaten the well-being of anyone else, enforced from below by people themselves through self-defence, not imposed from above.

State is the negation of Anarchy. State is an agent of chaos & injustice. Its enforces its injustice through violence as it centralises most power through a rigid hierarchy & wields this power to serve the interests of ruling class (those who have access to this power) --- while terrorising the people it imposes itself over.

In essence, the judge is using the definition of State (a tyrant & a chaos agent) to blame Anarchy. In his confusion about words, he is threatening people with better society, one of Anarchy --- a society without a government, a society without domination. When existing system is giving the exact results it's designed for --- of tyranny & chaos, he goes on to blame something other than the system itself, which he personally benefited as a member of ruling class till recently --- and still benefits from. Most likely, he might not even know various political ideologies (understandable since the qualifications required to get promoted to Indian Supreme Court requires more of lobbying talent than wider understanding of Society & Power), which explains why he used those words. Since Indian Mainstream Media including Newspapers are essentially propaganda agents for rich & powerful, this explains why they publish these narratives that makes ~~no sense~~ anti sense.

## Self-certification

Let's take look at another statement of him.

> I agree that the _collegium system_ must be more transparent. In the recent past, the proceedings of the _collegium_ have been put in the public domain. There is a greater transparency now. ...

We still have no idea why any decision is made the way its made in _collegium system_[^collegium-system], but still Judiciary gives itself self-certificates about "greater transparency". Everyone knows the essential element needed to move higher in the food chain within Indian Judiciary is lobbying of Politicians & Judges i.e influence peddling. I personally heard stories (from trusted lawyers) that there is a pay-for-appointment scheme (only for some Judge positions, not for all Judge positions), atleast in one High Court I am aware of i.e open corruption.

Since Indian Judiciary has weaponized _Contempt of Court_ power to attack whistleblowers, silence critics & shield itself from accountability, what's the basis for these claims about alleged transparency (self-certification) from Indian Judiciary --- let alone "greater transparency"?

[^collegium-system]: _Collegium system_ is self-appointment process invented by Judicial bureaucrats, where Judges will decide amongst themselves (self-dealing scheme) who will succeed them in courts, with no input from public or political opposition. This "process" enables Judges to send their buddy names to Executive for appointment as next "Justices" & Executive in turn have to approve/reject the names for appointment. Judges can override Executive decision if they reiterate same name again, but this option is generally not exercised. Since Executive have the power to frustrate these recommendations by rejecting it outright/not making any decision on specific names in time bound manner, Executive forces a closed room deal with Judiciary. This deal usually involves Judicial bureaucrats agreeing to install some pliable Judges Executive want as "Justices" in next recommendations/promotions (or) drop some names of Judges that have proven themselves somewhat independent (or) transfer some inconvenient Judges (or) who knows what other corrupt deals both of them enter into behind closed doors. Thanks to this "process", all these new pliable "Justices" Executive installed in Court will then decide whether Executive has violated laws or not, in all future cases involving legality of Executive's actions.

## Concern trolling

Then he concern trolls like this.

> India has one of the lowest judge-to-population ratios. In most countries, the ratio is about 50 judges per million population. We have a sanctioned strength ratio of nearly 20 per million, but the actual ratio is about 15 per million. Appointing judges is not enough. The infrastructure of the district judiciary is abysmal, to say the least. The judiciary has no control over funds and if the government does not provide funds, infrastructure cannot be improved. ... Judges also work before and after their regular court hours and on weekends, reading files, preparing and dictating judgments, besides performing administrative duties. These working days are not taken into consideration.

This is the same nonsense as Modi claiming (bullshitting) he is working 18hrs day --- evidently in his case --- to sell society to his rich buddies, collect his commission/bribes & destroy whatever is left of society.

Who asked these Judges to work over weekends (or) long hours?

When it served Indian Judiciary interests, it invented brand-new powers of self-appointment (_collegium system_) by "interpreting" Constitution, invented Public Interest Litigation (PIL) jurisdiction out of whole cloth. PIL is the most illegitimate jurisdiction Indian Judiciary has invented using which it can pick up any issue & non-issue by removing standing requirement (_locus standi_), pass any judgment on issues not before it, adjudicate on matters without petitioners, adjudicate on matters without giving notice to affected parties, refused to allow affected parties to join the dispute as an interested party, deliver orders & judgments that doesn't pass smell test, accountable to nobody however grave the harm they cause --- all done at the whims of judges with no constraints.

None of these powers are mentioned/implied in "Constitution". Judges invented & gave themselves these powers even after these self-appointment powers were deliberately denied in Constitutional debates & Constitution.

Indian Judiciary goes far beyond Constitution when it comes to feathering its own nest, but for some reason it cant pass a simple judgment that says --- all reasonable funds needed for fulfilling all judicial functions (infrastructure, salaries, ...) considering 50 judges/million population, must be automatically added to budget. Why cant Judiciary declare that deprival of required funding amounts to violation of right to fair trial, which is a straightforward violation of Constitution? What's the difficulty in passing such a rational judgment? Indian Supreme Court has a long & proud track record of passing quite a lot of awful Judgments that served its interests & interests of its powerful buddies. But when it comes to things that minimise harm to people, it pretends to be powerless. Are Judges not passing such Judgments because they don't know the legality of such a common sense judgment? Ofcourse, they know. They didn't pass --- likely wont pass --- such Judgment because Judiciary as a class (along with its powerful bed-fellows --- State, Capital, ...) benefit from existing system.

Status-quo i.e the man-made artificial scarcity of lack of Judicial infrastructure in India, always keeps the system underfunded & ensures anyone who is thrown/pulled into the system suffers thoroughly & totally. By being unaccountable & unresponsive, this Judicial system gives "incentives" to its victims by giving them an opportunity to find someone to help them jump the queue i.e peddle influence by hiring highest paid lawyers (that have backdoor understanding with "Justices")/"big people", who can help move victim's petition quicker in the system for a price/consideration i.e. enable large scale systemic corruption --- moral & money --- through influence peddling. If you are not lucky to be rich/powerful who can pay (or) have connections (knows "big people"/knows someone who knows "big people"/have friends who know insiders, ...), you suffer its malicious callousness & cruelty.

It's the system --- both Judiciary & Executive/Legislature currently benefit from --- is the root of the problem & they don't want any structural changes to it. What both sides (Judiciary & Executive/Legislature) want is exercise unaccountable & illegitimate power they currently enjoy in existing system --- in peace.

## Conclusion

End of the day, Judiciary at its core is a political actor wearing legal clothes as it ultimately decides what political, economic, social & other rights we all have, without ever proving to us its judgements are inline with our interests --- ofcourse, by "interpreting" so-called Constitution & Laws. If we go by history of Indian Judiciary, it mostly "interprets" Constitution (aka tea-leaf reading) to serve its own interests & interests of it allies i.e forces of hegemony --- State/Executive, Capital, Majoritarianism, ... by undermining liberty, autonomy, equity, ... of its victims (people), while simultaneously --- with a forked tongue --- publicly singing praises about liberty, autonomy, equity, ....

Executive/Legislature is very similar. Indian State (far far worse than avg) --- just like most other States --- has monopolised all coercive tools & most tools of manipulation (media, indoctrination through education, ...) in order to hold us hostage. Holding us hostage helps it sell access to all of us to the highest bidder without our informed consent. It strips us of our resources (natural/intellectual/markets --- labour, financial, retail, .../otherwise) i.e steals our resources, sells access to these resources to its buddies (brands this looting as so-called "investment", "divestment", "development", "liberalisation" & recently even more brazenly calls it "monetization pipeline"), claims our resources are its own (calls it State/Government property), hides information from us & terrorises us for "our own safety". By selling access to markets & controlling the rules of _collective bargaining_ i.e tilting rules in favor of its buddies aka "regulating", it leaves all its powerless victims at the mercy of their buddies. In otherwords, it systematically undermines its victims when it comes to their autonomy & economic well-being. Best part: It makes us (its victims) fund its tyranny over us.

The sooner we understand the game at play, the sooner we start thinking about solutions to the problems we face.
