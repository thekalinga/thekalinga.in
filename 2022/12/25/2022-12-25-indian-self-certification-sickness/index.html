<p>Today, I came across <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221223072059/https://www.outlookindia.com/national/why-the-recent-attack-on-judiciary-is-absolutely-uncalled-for-magazine-246901">this article</a> written in by a former Indian Supreme Court Judge. The thrust of his argument is about how Executive branch of Indian State with its comments is attempting to undermine Indian Judiciary.</p>

<p>This made me think about the following sickness I see pervasive throughout Indian society — one of self-certification. This “culture” of giving self certificates (or certificates by ones buddies/subordinates) has become more or less our second nature.</p>

<p>Pick any institution — Executive/Govt (Police, Army, Election Commission, …), Legislature, Judiciary, “Journalists”, Lawyers, Capitalists, Entertainers (or) any group that can exercise authority in any manner, most of them give self-certificates to themselves &amp; at times they cross certify each other (which people call circle jerk). Incase of Executive &amp; Judiciary, if anyone commits the “crime” of having heterodox opinion about these self-certificates &amp;/ circle jerk — aka BS — amongst ruling class, expresses ot openly &amp; loudly, thanks to World’s Best Constitution™ we have in India, they “legally” terrorise people by threatening harm their liberty/property/person.</p>

<h2 id="legitimacy">Legitimacy</h2>

<p>Let’s take a look at the legitimacy of Judicial Bureaucrats &amp; Executive/Legislature in India.</p>

<p>What legitimacy does a Judicial bureaucratic wing that none of us ever agreed were neutral arbitrators have in adjudicating all our disputes — affecting ~1.4 billion people?</p>

<p>How about Executive/Legislative wings?</p>

<p>Does forcing people to press a button [in voting machine] once every 5yrs amounts to people giving informed consent? Aren’t these “elections” in our so-called “Democracy” nothing but sham exercises in which most/all of us are coerced to certify the transfer of power from one faction of ruling class to another — even if we dont want to give up power — with our role curtailed to mere button pressing [in voting machine]/checking a box [in ballot]?</p>

<p>Does a system in which we have barely any say (in reality almost none) in how its actually run have any legitimacy?</p>

<h2 id="anarchy">Anarchy</h2>

<p>Look now take a look at the framing of argument from the article.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The citizens of this country have great faith in the judiciary. Such strident attacks may erode that faith. If this happens, our country would cease to be governed by the rule of law and only anarchy and tyranny will reign. …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I cant tell if these statements are borne out of ignorance (or) delusion (or) class solidarity with his [ruling] class (or) its a claptrap.</p>

<p>There is a saying that goes something like: <em>fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me</em>. Given what we know about the history of Indian Supreme Court &amp; its appointments (self-dealing &amp; collusion with all forces of hegemony — executive, capital, majoritarianism, casteism, …), who are these people that have “great faith” in our so-called “Supreme” &amp; “Justices”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>? Why do they have such irrational &amp; religious faith in this institution that lords over them with no accountability? Is it because its victims don’t have a choice in the matter except accepting its proclamations — however anti-factual they might be?</p>

<p>“Rule of law” i.e. imposition of laws [that most of us never consented to voluntarily] is somehow good — even if the laws are bad &amp; actively harmful (which many Indian laws are), how?</p>

<p>Anarchy is the absence of Tyranny.</p>

<p>Is the former SC Judge using another definition of Anarchy i.e. <em>chaos</em>, which is what all other political structures (including current one we are coerced to live under in India) that are built around domination/tyranny create? Anarchism does have order, but it’s not the kind of order that’s enforced through domination/tyranny (which is what State is all about), rather it’s the order achieved through non-dominating means i.e. voluntary cooperation backed by autonomy &amp; self-defence.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Definition</p>

  <p>Anarchism: The political theory that a community is best organized by the voluntary cooperation of individuals, rather than by a government, which is regarded as being coercive by nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In essence, Anarchy is the ultimate goal of a mature society, where everyone will be able to fulfill one’s potential — wanting to what one wants to do with one’s life through voluntary cooperation without being dominated by another individual/group, which requires ensuring no one will be allowed to accumulate disproportionate power (political/economical/weaponry/…) to threaten the well-being of others.</p>

<p>State is the negation of Anarchy. State is an agent of chaos &amp; injustice as it centralises most power &amp; wields it to serve interests of ruling class (those who have access to this power) — while terrorising the people it imposes itself over.</p>

<p>One would expect these so-called “Justices” to have some basic understanding of political philosophy before they write claptrap using words that mean almost opposite of what he means — esp when publishing them to a mainstream newspaper.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="self-appointment">Self-appointment</h2>

<p>Let’s take look at another statement of him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I agree that the <em>collegium system</em> must be more transparent. In the recent past, the proceedings of the collegium have been put in the public domain. There is a greater transparency now. …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We still have no idea why any decision is made the way its made in <em>collegium system</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>, but still Judiciary gives itself self-certificates about “greater transparency”.</p>

<h2 id="concern-trolling">Concern trolling</h2>

<p>Then he concern trolls like this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>India has one of the lowest judge-to-population ratios. In most countries, the ratio is about 50 judges per million population. We have a sanctioned strength ratio of nearly 20 per million, but the actual ratio is about 15 per million. Appointing judges is not enough. The infrastructure of the district judiciary is abysmal, to say the least. The judiciary has no control over funds and if the government does not provide funds, infrastructure cannot be improved. … Judges also work before and after their regular court hours and on weekends, reading files, preparing and dictating judgments, besides performing administrative duties. These working days are not taken into consideration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the same nonsense as Modi claiming (bullshitting) he is working 18hrs day — evidently — to sell society to his rich buddies &amp; destroy whatever is left.</p>

<p>Who asked these Judges to work over weekends (or) long hours?</p>

<p>When it served Indian Judiciary interests, it invented brand-new powers of self-appointment (<em>collegium system</em>) by “interpreting” Constitution, invented Public Interest Litigation (PIL) jurisdiction (most illegitimate jurisdiction, using which it can pick up any issue by removing standing requirement (locus standi), pass any judgment on issues not before it, adjudicate on matters without petitioners, adjudicate on matters without giving notice to adverse parties &amp; refusing to allow affected parties to join the dispute as an interested party, pass judgments that doesn’t pass smell test, liable to nobody no matter the harm they cause, all done at the whims of judges with no constraints) out of whole cloth.</p>

<p>None of these powers are no where mentioned/implied in “Constitution”. Judges invented &amp; gave themselves these powers even after these self-appointment powers were deliberately denied in Constitutional debates &amp; Constitution.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>But, for some reason, Indian Judiciary cant pass a simple judgment that says all reasonable funds needed for fulfilling all judicial functions (infrastructure, salaries, …) considering 50 judges/million population, must be automatically added to budget. Why dint they pass such a judgment? Indian Supreme Court has a history of passing many awful Judgments &amp; this Judgment not a bad Judgment as Judiciary (going by their own logic) is an essential element of so-called “Democracy” it imposes itself over. Is it because they don’t know that they can pass such a simple common sense judgment? Ofcourse, they know. They didn’t pass &amp; likely wont pass it because they as a class (judicial) benefit from existing system.</p>

<p>Status-quo i.e the man-made artificial scarcity of lack of Judicial infrastructure in India, always keeps the system underfunded &amp; ensures anyone who is thrown/pulled into the system suffers enough. By being unaccountable &amp; unresponsive, this Judicial system gives “incentives” to all its victims an option to jump the queue to peddle influence by hiring highest paid lawyers (that have backdoor understanding with “Justices”) who can move your petition quicker in the system for a price/consideration i.e. enable large scale corruption through influence peddling.</p>

<p>It’s the system — both Judiciary &amp; Executive/Legislature currently benefit from — is the root of the problem &amp; they don’t want any structural changes to it. What both sides (Judiciary &amp; Executive/Legislature) want is exercise existing unaccountable &amp; illegitimate power they currently have in current system — in peace.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>End of the day, Judiciary at its core is a political actor wearing legal clothes as it ultimately decides what political, economic &amp; social rights we all have without ever proving to us its judgement is inline with our interests — ofcourse, by “interpreting” so-called Constitution &amp; Laws. If we go by history of Indian Judiciary, it mostly “interprets” Constitution (tea-leaf reading) to serve its own interests &amp; interests of it allies i.e forces of hegemony — State, Capital, Majoritarianism, … by undermining liberty, autonomy, equity, …, while simultaneously — with a forked tongue — publicly singing praises about liberty, autonomy, equity, ….</p>

<p>Executive/Legislature is very similar. Indian State (worse than avg) — just like most other States — has monopolised all coercive tools &amp; most tools of manipulation (media, indoctrination through education, …) in order to hold us hostage. Holding us hostage helps it sell access to all of us to the highest bidder without our informed consent. It strips us of our resources (natural/intellectual/markets — labour, financial, retail, …/otherwise) i.e steals our resources, sells access to these resources to its buddies, by selling access to market, it decides what we should be paid for our work. It steals our resources, claims our common resources are its own, terrorises us for “our own safety”. It makes us fund its tyranny over us.</p>

<p>The sooner we understand the game at play, the sooner we start thinking about solutions to the problems we face.</p>

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>In India — like in many other countries — Judges call themselves “Justices”. They think so highly of themselves that they wont mind butchering the word <em>Justice</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>On 2nd thought, given that mainstream media (incl newspapers) in India amounts to nothing more than propaganda for rich &amp; powerful — with rare exceptions, this is probably something we should expect. <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>Self-appointment process invented by Judicial bureaucrats where they will decide amongst themselves who will succeed them in courts, with no inout from public or political opposition. This “process” enables Judges send their nominations to Executive, who then have to approve/reject the names for appointment (Judges can override Executive decision if they reiterate same name again). Since Executive have the power to frustrate recommendations sent by Judiciary aka self-dealing scheme by Judiciary by rejecting it outright/not making any decision on specific names, there will be a closed room deal with made between Judiciary &amp; Executive so Judiciary will install some pliable judges Executive want as “Justices”. All of these “Justices” then decide whether Executive has violated laws or not in the future in cases involving legality of executive actions. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:4">
      <p>Indian Constitution mocking called World’s Best Constitution™ is written by so-called “freedom fighters” aka agents of Indian rich — Nehru &amp; co. A good portion of this Constitution is copied from an ordinary law British wrote for its subjects — Indians. With enough loopholes in Constitution to terrorise everyone i.e to lord over everyone thru thread of violence, these “freedom fighters” claimed their subjects “gave themselves” this “Constitution” (Preamble to Indian Constitution — WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA … GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION). <a href="#fnref:4" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
